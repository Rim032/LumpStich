## (10/6/23) MAJOR UPDATE HAS BEEN RELEASED! INCLUDES GUI.

## Lump Stich
### Description

A new .BSP file is stiched together from a protected .BSP file and it's .LMP file. This new .BSP file can be played in-game and decompiled unlike the protected .BSP file which lacked entities and couldn't be decompiled.

### Reason

I want to allow people to decompile maps for reverse engineering and learning. This allowed me to further explore the structure and overall inner-workings of a .bsp file. I've had a great time both learning about .lmp and .bsp files while constructing this program.

### Misc.

Note: If there are any bugs/issue please let me know.
Only GMOD and HL2 maps have been tested. A warning will be given if using a BSP version other than 20.
