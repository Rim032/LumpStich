##Lump Stich##
###Description###

This is a program that repairs and builds a new .bsp file, that is decompileable and useable, from it's lump file (.lmp). In a basic explanation, it reads the header of the .bsp, stores its file offset, file length and insert, along with cleaning up, the entity data contained in the .lmp file.

###Reason###

I want to allow people to decompile maps for reverse engineering and learning. Furthermore, this allowed me to further explore the structure and overall inner-workings of a .bsp file. I've had a great time both learning about .lmp and .bsp files while constructing this program. :)

###Misc.###

Note: If there are any bugs/issue please let me know.
I've only tested it with .bsp files related to HL2 and GMOD.
